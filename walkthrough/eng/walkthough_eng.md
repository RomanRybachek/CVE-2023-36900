This code is typical for drivers. It is [WPP tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/wpp-software-tracing). 
So it is not interesting to us. But we should pay attention to the return code. It is 0xC0000095 that means [STATUS_INTEGER_OVERFLOW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/596a1078-e883-4972-9bbc-49e60bebca55).
That's a good hint for us.
